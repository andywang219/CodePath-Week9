# CodePath-Week9
# Project 9 - Honeypots

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

> Objective: Learn about Network Security by attacking and being attacked at vulnarable networked resources. Multiple Honey Pot VM instances were created to demonstrate it.

## Honeypot(s) Deployed:
* conpot
* snort
* dionaea

## Summary of Data Collected
* First, I had to set up a mhn-admin vm on google cloud by following the instructions. Second, I created three Honeypots to host three separate attacks. Here are the data that I've collected from the three Honeypots
<br/>
1. Attack Statistic

<br/>
2. Attack Report

<br/>
3. Payloads Report

<br/>
4. Sensors

You can view the attack reports in session.json.

## Notes

The set up was difficult because some instructions weren't clear and the repository that we were supposed to clone didn't work.
